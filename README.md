#FromCpp
I wrote the implementation of the user-defined manipulators as given in Section 21.4.6.3 of the book entitled The C++ Programming Language, Special Edition by Bjarne Stroustrup.

The test program and the output of the test program are as given in the same folder.
In order to make it easier to integrate the program with the test program, I named the program From.h.

##How to compile & run this program
This program is written in Linux environment, GUN make, and GCC(Gnu compiler collection.)
Just type the commands (in BASH shell),
```
make help
```

or

```
make clean dep all
```
It will automatically compile all the necessary files/codes, then generate the execution file.
Then type this,
```
./EXENAME
```

In the end, it will work successfully.
